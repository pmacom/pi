I would like to upgrade our local wifi network to have 3 SSIDs. One SSID should handle SUPER SECURE critical network infrastructures and take priority over any other supplemental networking traffic requests. Another SSID should provide SUPER SECURE general network traffic, and the third and last SSID should provide a guest account that is sandboxed and can not slip past the SUPER SECURE wall that was put into place.
